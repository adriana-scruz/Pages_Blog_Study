          <h3>#1 — Grey text on colored backgrounds</h3>
          <p>
            Each of us has experience using web applications and visiting
            websites in open areas, under direct sunlight. And everything would
            be fine if the contrast of the font with the background allowed us
            to recognize words and numbers. However, most webmasters forget
            about these nuances for some reason. As a result, mobile users are
            forced to cover the screen with their hands or go into the shadows
            to somehow cope with the situation. Think twice before choosing a
            solid background for a gray font.
